# Coding Challenges Python
This repository is a place to store various HackerRank Challenges in Python.
The repository is a place to store my work for reference and interview preparation. 
These are smaller, problem-solving scripts and do not accumulate to a larger project. 
Larger challenges may break down into several files within a challenge directory. In this case, the project files contain run information. 
Smaller challenges run from a single script using main to test functions.
Automated test may be incorporated later.
